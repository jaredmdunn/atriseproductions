With the permission of Blake's family, the cabaret was turned into an event to honor Blake's memory and to raise money for his family. On August 21, after the funeral ceremony, eighteen students, including the entire cast of <em>You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown</em>, performed eleven original songs for an audience of over 300 people.</p>",
